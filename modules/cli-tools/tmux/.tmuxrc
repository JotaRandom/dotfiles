# Symlink descriptor for tmux configuration
# This file should be symlinked to ~/.tmuxrc
# which points to ~/.tmux.conf
#
# Standard tmux looks for ~/.tmux.conf automatically.
# This .tmuxrc is provided as an alternative path for some configurations
# that explicitly look for ~/.tmuxrc (e.g., older tmux versions or specific tools).
