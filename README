My Dotfiles

Tris is the record and tweaks of my dotfiles like .bashrc .zshrc and 
others spesific or less accecible files like issue

Is possible that  add others specials files or REALLY tweaked configs

Frecuently...REALLY frecuently I change my WM/DE for this reazon the 
updates aren't so freccuents

bye
